# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description of the Project
This project is a simplified clone of the AirBnB web application.  
The goal of the project is to understand how a full web application is built,
starting from a command-line interpreter and progressively adding components
such as storage, web static content, databases, APIs, and a full web framework.

This first stage focuses on building a command interpreter that manages
AirBnB objects.

## Description of the Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a command-line interface (CLI) used to manage
the objects of the AirBnB project. It allows users to create, update, destroy,
and retrieve objects such as users, places, cities, and amenities.

### How to Start the Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is started by running the `console.py` file:

```bash
$ ./console.py
