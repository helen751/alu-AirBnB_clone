# AirBnB Clone – Command Line Interpreter

## Project Description
The **AirBnB Clone** project is a simplified version of the AirBnB platform.  
This first stage focuses on building a **command-line interpreter** that manages the core objects of the application.

The command interpreter allows users to:
- Create new objects (User, Place, City, etc.)
- Retrieve objects from storage
- Update object attributes
- Delete objects
- Persist data using file storage (JSON)

This project is part of a larger system that will later include a web application, RESTful API, and database storage.
